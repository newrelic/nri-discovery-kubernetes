### A note about vulnerabilities

New Relic is committed to the privacy and security of our customers and their
data. We believe that providing coordinated disclosure by security researchers
and engaging with the security community are important means to achieve our
security goals.  If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this
project or any of New Relic's products or websites, we welcome and greatly

## Setting up your environment

This Open Source Software can be used in a large number of environments, all of
which have their own quirks and best practices. As such, while we are happy to
provide documentation and assistance for unmodified Open Source Software, we
cannot provide support for your specific environment or your modifications to
the code.

## PR Guidelines

Failing to comply with the following guidelines may result in your PR being
rejected or not reviewed by the maintainers until the issues are fixed:

- CI job runs and passes.
- Adheres to the spirit of our various styleguides.
- Has thorough unit test coverage.
- Appropriate documentation is included.
- PR title summarizes the change.
- PR description includes:
  - A detailed summary of what changed.
  - The motivation for the change.
  - A link to each issue that is closed by the PR (e.g. Closes #123).

Keep in mind that these are just guidelines and may not apply in every case.

## Coding Style Guidelines

This project follows a coding style enforced using linters developed by
the Golang community.

### Running Coding Style Validation

Validating the code to see if it conforms to the project style is simple. Just
invoke:

```bash
$ make validate
```

## Testing Guidelines

This project includes a suite of unit tests with each package which should be
used to verify your changes don't break existing functionality.

### Running Tests

Running the test suite is simple. Just invoke:

```bash
$ make test
```

### Writing Tests

For most contributions it is strongly recommended to add additional tests which
exercise your changes.

This helps us efficiently incorporate your changes into our mainline codebase
and provides a safeguard that your change won't be broken by future
development.

There are some rare cases where code changes do not result in changed
functionality (e.g. a performance optimization) and new tests are not required.
In general, including tests with your pull request dramatically increase the
chances it will be accepted.
